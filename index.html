                Hello everyone! I'm a Florida native from the great city of Stuart. I moved to Orlando, Fl the first
                time to attend the University of Central Florida where I received my bachelor's degree in criminal
                justice. Since then, I moved around quite a bit, just to find myself back here in Orlando. I am
                currently employeed with Moe's Southwest Grill as an area manager.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have recently finished the full stack UCF Coding Bootcamp where I have become proficient in front and
                backend web
                development. Over the course of this class, I have been able to amass a handful of projects that can be
                viewed on
                my portfolio page. I enjoy learning new technologies and solving problems. Though I have many
                transferable skills from my
                long career in food service, the attribute that is most important that I can take from that field is my abilitiy
                to take the
                impossible and make it possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a proud husband and father of two. So whenever I am not working or coding, I try to spend as
                much
                time with my family as I can. If I do get anytime to myself, you can catch me playing my favorite moba
                video
                game or browsing YouTube. Thank you so much for stopping by my website. I hope you have enjoyed your
                stay.
